# Machine Learning Tutorials

Welcome to the Machine Learning Tutorials repository! This repository contains all the coding related files related to the machine learning tutorials that I teach. The repository is organized into different folders based on the topic of the tutorial.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have a basic understanding of Python and machine learning concepts. If you're new to machine learning, you can check out some beginner-friendly tutorials online.

## Table of Contents

Here's a list of the topics covered in this repository:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

As the instructor of the Machine Learning class, I am committed to keeping the files in this repository up-to-date with the latest concepts and techniques in the field. Regular updates will be made to ensure that students have access to the most current information. These updates will reflect the progress of the class and will be made available to all students in the repository. I am dedicated to providing the best learning experience possible, and keeping the files updated is one way in which I strive to achieve that goal.

## Main Motive

My goal in teaching machine learning is to equip students with the tools and techniques they need to tackle complex problems and drive innovation in a wide range of fields. I believe that by providing a strong foundation in machine learning concepts, students can make meaningful contributions to their chosen professions and society as a whole. Ultimately, my hope is that the knowledge and skills gained through my teaching will empower individuals to pursue their passions and make a positive impact on the world.
